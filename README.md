# Pokéwire

For all your Pokemon whereabouts needs.


## About

Where’s that Pokemon?

* A solution to this question is our app PokeWire!

* PokeWire - is an app that is designed to give you the location of a particular Pokemon within a certain game.

* We believe this app will be essential for any Pokemon Trainer that has set out on their journey. Whether you're in the Kalos region or all the way in the Unova region, you can find out if the Pokemon you're looking to join your party is located in your game.

## Functionality

With Pokéwire you can complete a plethora of tasks to aid you in your journey to catch them all including:

* Search for your favorite Pokémon.

* Obtain the basic information of that Pokémon.

* Recieve information about the game that the Pokémon is located in.

* Learn the locations within the game in which to encounter that Pokémon.

## User Story 
 
 As avid Pokémon Trainers ourselves, we wanted to create an easy way in which we can learn the location and basic information of whatever Pokémon we are currently pursuing to capture and join our party.
 
 ## Technologies
 
 The technologies utilized to make our app Pokéwire work include:
 
* Bulma Framework

* JQuery

* Iconify

* And the Third Party APIs - RAWG & PokeAPI

## Future Development

We hope to further improve our app by:

* Adding more detailed imformation and useful stats to the Pokémon information card.

* Add additional avatars to show evolutions and any other forms a Pokémon may have.

* Adding the ability to provide store location in which to buy the games.
